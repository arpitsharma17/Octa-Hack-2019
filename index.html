<h1>Farmers</h1>
<p style="font-size: 18px;">First of all, we have made this platform for the development of farmers because from the last few years there are immense numbers of problems faced by the farmers.
We all work for improving the conditions of farmers. Our first motive is to provide a platform to farmers where they can put up the problems they face in terms of selling of crops, crop failure , inadequate price of their crops etc when the government is not responding to their problems. This platform helps them to put up their crops for sale at a price which is fixed by government, as there is no third party taking any commission for providing a platform to sell their products. The farmers can directly contact the buyer through our platform. Farmers can also buy seeds and different fertilizers from this platform  at a price which is recognized by the government.</p>

<h1>Buyers</h1>
<p style="font-size: 18px;">This platform is not only for farmers market but it also works efficiently for buyers too. Buyers can find the exact rate of crops, manures and fertilizers etc as excluding commission of third party distributors. Buyers can directly contact the farmers and buy directly from them. Buyers can put up complaints regarding the crops they bought from farmers and can take necessary action.</p>
